How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?

The staging area allows you to gather the files you wanted to commit together in one

Everytimea logical update has been made, using the git add to add the file to
the staging area. Once the whole logical piece has been updated, commit the file.

Branches would be useful if you want to fork an item or if you want to test

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

Diagrams give a visual representation of what is happening. For a visual learner
like myself, diagrams are vital for me to understand what is going on.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

The merging of 2 branches allow other users/features/bugs to be commited with the
master copy. The diagrams represent what is happening and is vital to make sure no 
commits are lost when removing a branch.

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
