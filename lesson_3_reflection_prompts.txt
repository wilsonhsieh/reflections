When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    By having a reomte repository, you have the benefit of having your data
    backed up in the cloud. Also, other users can contribute and help you
    make your code better.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Sometimes some of the suggestions by other people are not changes you
    want to make. Another reason would be when you are coding out an experimental
    feature. You may want to get the code in better shape before releasing to the
    public.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are essential a clone in GitHub remote repo. If you want to copy a repo
    and make changes, you can work a project and make the edits in your account.
    Clones are used to copy a repo from your own GitHub account to your local repo.
    You can also clone repos within your own Github account and within your own local
    repo. Branches are located in a single repo. You create branches for additional features,
    bug fixes, etc.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
