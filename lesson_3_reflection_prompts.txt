When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    By having a reomte repository, you have the benefit of having your data
    backed up in the cloud. Also, other users can contribute and help you
    make your code better.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Sometimes some of the suggestions by other people are not changes you
    want to make. Another reason would be when you are coding out an experimental
    feature. You may want to get the code in better shape before releasing to the
    public.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are essential a clone in GitHub remote repo. If you want to copy a repo
    and make changes, you can work a project and make the edits in your account.
    Clones are used to copy a repo from your own GitHub account to your local repo.
    You can also clone repos within your own Github account and within your own local
    repo. Branches are located in a single repo. You create branches for additional features,
    bug fixes, etc.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    If you are traveling or will not have access to the internet, having the last
    stored commit locally will allow the developer to continue to work on the 
    most recent file (when they last connected remote). This would hopefully also
    reduce the chance of the merge failing and require manually updates.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I would be using SVN or some other method of sharing and document file changes.
    This would be harder due to not having offline access. Also Git and GitHub are
    very fast processes that help document changes really well. The only benefit of
    not using Git and GitHub is I would have avoided the learn curve.... Too late!

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
